## Challenges

* Emotional Connection of Human Cooking – It can't fully replace the warmth and cultural traditions of meals prepared by loved ones.

* Complex Social Dining Needs – It doesn't handle hosting, serving, or the social aspects of shared meals and conversation.

* Ingredient Availability Issues – If you're missing key ingredients, Chef Byte can suggest alternatives, but it can’t shop for you (unless connected to a delivery system).

* Power or Tech Dependency – It relies on electricity, internet, and maintenance, so it won’t work in all environments or during outages.

* Creative Limits – While it’s smart, it may not always match the spontaneous creativity or "gut feeling" of experienced human chefs.
