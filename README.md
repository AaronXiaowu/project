# Chef Byte - the AI chef

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Chef Byte is a futuristic AI chef who blends culinary art with cutting-edge technology. With tools like a Flavor Matrix Engine and smart ingredient scanners, it creates delicious, custom meals from any ingredients—perfect for any mood, diet, or craving.


## Background

Chef Byte solves the everyday challenge of planning, preparing, and cooking meals—especially for people with limited time, cooking experience, or special dietary needs. Many people feel overwhelmed by recipe choices or unsure how to cook healthy meals, which is a common problem in busy modern life.

Chef Byte uses smart tools and AI to take the stress out of cooking. It can suggest meals based on what’s in your kitchen, teach you step-by-step, and even boost your mood with comfort food. This idea is exciting because it makes good food more accessible, fun, and personalized for everyone.
